  <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

  <p>The Protégé plugin for XML2OWL allows users to use the Protégé
  program and its GUI interface (instead of the command-line) to run
  XML2OWL.</p>

  <p>This page documents the XML2OWL plugin's Protégé user interface. For
  instructions on the mapping mechanism and rule authoring, see the
  <a href="../../../core/src/main/resources/doc/index.html">core
  manual</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

  <p>Building and installation is done with Ant, following the
  Protégé guidelines. Make sure your PROTEGE_HOME variable is set
  appropriately. Then build and install with ant, 

  <xmp> % mvn install</xmp>,

  from the protege directory.

  <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

  When you next run Protégé, the XML2OWL plugin should be mentioned
  among others while loading. Once the Protégé window opens, XML2OWL
  should have two menu entries, both in the Window menu hierarchy: the
  XML2OWL view is accessible under Window -> Views -> Ontology Views,
  and an XML2OWL tab can be found under Window -> Tabs.

  <h3 id="interface">User interface</h3>

  The XML2OWL mapper window has three areas: Rules, Data and
  Control. After the contents of a rules file and data file are put
  into the Rules and Data areas, respectively, the Control area
  initiates the mapping and the OWL ontology is updated accordingly.

  The contents of a rules file are pasted into the Rules
  textarea. They can be typed or pasted manually, or the Open button
  can be used to insert the contents of a file from the
  filesystem. The rules file can then be validated against
  the <a href="rules.xsd">XML2OWL rules schema</a> with the Validate
  button (this is not necessary, however, as it happens anyway as the
  first step in mapping).

  The contents of a data file are pasted into the Data textarea in
  exactly the same way as for the rules.

  The Control area has two buttons. When the Map button is clicked,
  the mapping program applies the rules to the data and adds the
  resulting new individuals and assertions to the OWL ontology. The
  last mapping can be undone by clicking on the Undo button.

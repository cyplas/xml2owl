  <P>REFER TO MAIN DOCUMENTATION APPROPRIATELY</P>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  This page documents the XML2OWL plugin's Protégé user interface. For
  instructions on the mapping mechanism and rule authoring, see the
  main <a href="manual.html">manual</a>.

  <h2>User interface</h2>

  The XML2OWL mapper window (accessible through the XML2OWL tab) has
  three areas: Rules, Data and Control. After the contents of a rules
  file and data file are put into the Rules and Data areas,
  respectively, the Control area initiates the mapping and the OWL
  ontology is updated accordingly.

  The contents of a rules file are pasted into the Rules
  textarea. They can be typed or pasted manually, or the Open button
  can be used to insert the contents of a file from the
  filesystem. The rules file can then be validated against
  the <a href="rules.xsd">XML2OWL rules schema</a> with the Validate
  button (this is not necessary, however, as it happens anyway as the
  first step in mapping).

  The contents of a data file are pasted into the Data textarea in
  exactly the same way as for the rules.

  The Control area has two buttons. When the Map button is clicked,
  the mapping program applies the rules to the data and adds the
  resulting new individuals and assertions to the OWL ontology. The
  last mapping can be undone by clicking on the Undo button.

  <h2 align="center">Mapping new XML data to existing OWL ontologies</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  The XML2OWL plugin allows for the semi-automatic mapping of XML data
  to an existing OWL ontology. New individuals and associated
  assertions are added based on pre-existing classes and
  properties. The mappings are determined by user-specified rules
  according to a particular XML schema.

  This plugin is particularly intended for when the user wants to
  integrate lots of data from one or more sources into the same OWL
  ontology, wants to have control over how the mapping is carried
  out, and is comfortable writing a basic XML document (unless someone
  else has already written one for him).

  <h3>Usage example</h3>

  Suppose that you run an online bookstore and want to store your data
  in book and author data in an OWL repository. You already have your
  OWL ontology structure defined, and you have an agreement with five
  different publishers to send you new book information on a regular
  basis in XML. You would like to automate the automatic mapping of
  the incoming data into your OWL ontology while allowing each
  publisher to send XML data according to their own XML schema. Once
  you have prepared 5 rule mapping files (one for each publisher), you
  could then use the XML2OWL plugin to automatically map the data
  into your ontology every time you get a new data file from one of
  the publishers.

  The figures below give a partial example. Figure 1 shows the book
  class in your pre-existing ontology in Protege. Figure 2 gives an
  example of a short datafile from the publisher Penguin. Figure 3
  lists a rule file which maps the datafiles from Penguin to your
  ontology, and Figure 4 shows one of the new individuals resulting
  from this example mapping.

  <h3>Authoring rules documents</h3>

  XML2OWL rules documents must adhere to the <a href="rules.xsd">rules
  XML schema</a>. Such documents define some general parameters and
  then provide rules for mapping XML data documents into new OWL
  individuals and assertions. The rules use XPath 2.0 expressions to
  identify nodes and construct IRI expressions for the OWL
  entities. This section describes the meaning and relationships of
  the elements of a rules document in detail.

  <h4>Top level</h4>

  The top-level element under which all other elements are included is
  called &lt;ontologyMappingElements&gt;. It has an optional
  &lt;namespaces&gt; element, an optional &lt;prefixIRI&gt; element,
  and an arbitrary number of mapping and collection elements (i.e.,
  &lt;mapToOWLIndividual&gt;, etc.).

  &lt;ontologyMappingElements&gt; also has one optional
  attribute:

  <ul>
    <li><i>strict</i>: if "false" (the default), ignore rules with
      less critical errors and continue; otherwise, it should be
      "true", in which case the mapping will abort if any error is
      encountered.
  </ul>

  <h4>Namespaces</h4>
  
  An optional &lt;namespaces&gt; element can define any number of
  namespaces. This is needed in addition to the standard XML namespace
  definitions so that these namespaces are also known to the XPath
  processor.
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;namespaces&gt;
      <ul>
        <li>&lt;namespace&gt;: declares a namespace for the XPath
          processor.
          <ul>
            <li><i>prefix</i>: the namespace prefix.
            <li><i>name</i>: the namespace name.
          </ul>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h4>Prefix IRI</h4> 

  An optional &lt;prefixIRI&gt; element can be used to define a
  default prefix to be prepended to the OWL entity IRIs generated
  during rule processing. The element can be either static or dynamic,
  as determined by its <i>dynamic</i> attribute.
  
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;prefixIRI&gt;
      <ul>
        <li><i>dynamic</i>: if "false" (the default), the contents should
          specify a literal quoted string; otherwise it should be "true",
          in which case it should specify an XPath expression, which will
          yield the prefix when evaluated against the XML data's root
          node.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h4>Individuals</h4>
  
  OWL individuals can be defined with the &lt;mapToOWLIndividual&gt;
  element. The elements can provide static or dynamic definitions. If
  they are dynamic, they can result in multiple individuals. The
  &lt;collectOWLIndividuals&gt; element can be used to gather the sets
  of individuals generated by &lt;mapToOWLIndividual&gt; into one
  group. &lt;mapToOWLIndividual&lt; and &lt;collectOWLIndividuals&gt;
  can be given a reference name, which can then be used to refer to
  the associated individuals in subsequent mapping rules.

  <ul>
    <li>&lt;mapToOWLIndividual&gt;
      <ul>
        <li><i>referenceName</i>: an optional reference name for the
        individuals
        <li>&lt;query&gt;: an optional XPath query which is evaluated
        against the XML data's root node to identify nodes
        corresponding to individuals
        <li>&lt;prefixIRI&gt;: determines a prefix IRI to be prepended
        to the result of the &lt;expression&gt; for the final IRI; if
        it is not provided, the global &lt;prefixIRI&gt; directly
        under &lt;ontologyMappingElements&gt; is used instead.
          <ul>
            <li><i>dynamic</i>Works just as the <i>dynamic</i>
            attribute of the global &lt;prefixIRI&gt;, except that if
            dynamic, the expression is evaluated against the node from
            the query element.
          </ul>
        <li>&lt;expression&gt;: an XPath expression which is processed
        against each node resulting from the query to yield the IRI
        ...
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h4>Class assertions</h4>

  <h4>Data property assertions</h4>

  <h4>Object property assertions</h4>

  <h4>Same/Different individual assertions</h4>

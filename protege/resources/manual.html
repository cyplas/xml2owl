  <h2 align="center">Mapping new XML data to existing OWL ontologies</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  The XML2OWL plugin allows for the semi-automatic mapping of XML data
  to an existing OWL ontology. New individuals and associated
  assertions are added based on pre-existing classes and
  properties. The mappings are determined by user-specified rules
  according to a particular XML schema.

  This plugin is particularly intended for when the user wants to
  integrate lots of data from one or more sources into the same OWL
  ontology, wants to have control over how the mapping is carried
  out, and is comfortable writing a basic XML document (unless someone
  else has already written one for him).

  <h3>Usage example</h3>

  Suppose that you run an online bookstore and want to store your data
  in book and author data in an OWL repository. You already have your
  OWL ontology structure defined, and you have an agreement with five
  different publishers to send you new book information on a regular
  basis in XML. You would like to automate the automatic mapping of
  the incoming data into your OWL ontology while allowing each
  publisher to send XML data according to their own XML schema. Once
  you have prepared 5 rule mapping files (one for each publisher), you
  could then use the XML2OWL plugin to automatically map the data
  into your ontology every time you get a new data file from one of
  the publishers.

  The figures below give a partial example. Figure 1 shows the book
  class in your pre-existing ontology in Protege. Figure 2 gives an
  example of a short datafile from the publisher Penguin. Figure 3
  lists a rule file which maps the datafiles from Penguin to your
  ontology, and Figure 4 shows one of the new individuals resulting
  from this example mapping.

  <h3>Authoring rules documents</h3>

   - general attributes, prefixes, namespaces<br>
   - individuals, references and collections<br>
   - classes<br>
   - data properties<br>
   - object properties<br>
   - same/different<br>

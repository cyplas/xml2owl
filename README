XML2OWL allows for the semi-automatic mapping of XML data to an
existing OWL ontology. New individuals and associated assertions are
added based on pre-existing classes and properties. The mappings are
determined by user-specified rules according to the XML2OWL rules
schema provided. Once rule processing is complete, a reasoner is
invoked for carrying out further inferences and executing SWRL
rules. XML2OWL is particularly suitable for when the user needs to
integrate lots of XML data from one or more sources into the same OWL
ontology and wants to have control over how the mapping is carried
out.

The repository also contains two extensions (a Protégé plugin and a
web crawler pre-processing module), but neither of these is yet
complete.

See src/site/resources/index.html for user documentation.
